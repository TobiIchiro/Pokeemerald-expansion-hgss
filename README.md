### Important: DO NOT use GitHub's "Download Zip" option. Using this option will not download the commit history required to update your expansion version or merge other feature branches. Instead, please read [this guide](https://github.com/Pawkkie/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo/wiki/The-Basics-of-GitHub) to learn how to fork the repository and clone locally from there.

## What is pokeemerald-expansion?

pokeemerald-expansion is a decomp hack base project based off pret's [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project. It's recommended that any new projects that plan on using it, to clone this repository instead of pret's vanilla repository, as we regurlarly incorporate pret's documentation changes. This is ***NOT*** a standalone romhack, and as such, most features will be unavailable and/or unbalanced if played as is.

If you use pokeemerald-expansion in your hack, please add RHH (Rom Hacking Hideout) to your credits list. Optionally, you can list the version used, so it can help players know what features to expect.
You can phrase it as the following:
```
Based off RHH's pokeemerald-expansion 1.9.1 https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/
```
